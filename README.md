# GCNA-cluster:文章标题
First, the GCNA-cluster algorithm constructed a weighted gene co-expression network for each patient.Secondly, network alignment was performed between pairs of gene co-expression networks, and the score of alignment was the similarity between patients. By extrapolating from this, a patient-patient similarity matrix can be obtained. Finally, cluster patients according to their similarity.
